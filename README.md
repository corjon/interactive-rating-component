## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use labels as radio buttons
- :has() parent selector
- style.display="none"/"block" performs faster than classList.add()/remove()
- How to use linear gradients

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-css-has-selector/) - I used the CSS :has() selector to select the parent label when a radio button was checked.
- [MeasureThat.net](https://www.measurethat.net/Benchmarks/Show/2985/0/styledisplay-none-vs-classlist-add-hide) - This performance benchmark shows that style.display="none"/"block" performs faster than classList.add()/remove()
